# Scala School
This project contains some IntelliJ worksheets that go along with an updated Scala School.  The idea behind the Scala
School is to bootstrap engineers that come from Java or C# and give them just enough in a guided manner to help orient them
with the language, the ZIO framework and the ecosystem in general.  There will be a lot of 'further reading' to dive deeper into
various topics as the goal here isn't to exhaustively cover any particular topic.

To get started with Scala, you should have the following installed at a minimum:

* JDK 17 - we recommend the latest Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK build at http://adoptium.net
* IntelliJ Community Edition (or another editor that has support for Scala) - version 2021.2.3 is the most recent at the time of this writing.  Be sure to enable the Scala Plugin during installation.  We recommend installing IntelliJ via the JetBrains Toolbox.  This will help you keep your IntelliJ up to date and manage all the files for you. - https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/
